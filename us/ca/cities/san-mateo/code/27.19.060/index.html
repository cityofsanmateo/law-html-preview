                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Applicability. This section applies to ADUs located on a lot with an existing or proposed Single-Family Dwelling Structure. Number of Units. A lot with an existing or proposed Single-Family Dwelling Structure may include any combination of the following three types of ADUs, provided that each meets the applicable development standards.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> One Attached or Conversion ADU.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> One Detached New Construction ADU.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> One JADU, provided it is located within the walls of an existing or proposed Single-Family Dwelling Structure.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Maximum Unit Size and Floor Area Ratio (FAR). FAR and unit size maximums for both Attached and Detached ADUs in excess of 800 square feet are governed by the maximum FAR established by the underlying zoning district and remaining floor area allowance available on the lot. Up to 800 square feet of ADU living area, including New Construction State Exempt ADUs, is exempt from the maximum FAR for each lot with a Single-Family Dwelling Structure. This exemption does not apply to JADU living area. In addition, the following shall apply:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> An ADU shall not be larger, in terms of living area, than the primary residential dwelling unit. However, when the primary residential dwelling unit is less than or equal to 800 square feet in size, a State Exempt ADU of up to 800 square feet is allowed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> A Conversion ADU within the walls of an existing primary dwelling unit or accessory structure is not subject to size requirements. ADU conversions may be expanded up to 150 square feet beyond the existing footprint provided the expansion is used to accommodate ingress and egress to the ADU.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Height. The specific height maximums are applicable to all zoning districts which permit ADUs.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> Attached Accessory Dwelling Units. Maximum building height for an attached ADU is 24 feet to top plateline and 32 feet to roof peak as measured from existing grade.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> Detached Accessory Dwelling Units. Maximum building height for a detached ADU is 18 feet to top plateline and 24 feet to roof peak as measured from existing grade.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Setbacks. An ADU shall have setbacks as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> No setback shall be required for an existing garage or accessory structure that is converted to an ADU which is constructed in the same location and to the same dimensions, footprint, and height as the existing structure; or for a Detached ADU that is proposed in the rear one-third of a lot that otherwise meets all requirements of accessory buildings and structures in required yards of R1 districts pursuant to <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27.70" title="Chapter 27.70 ACCESSORY BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES IN REQUIRED YARDS">Chapter 27.70</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> A minimum setback of four feet shall be required from the side and rear lot lines for all new ADU construction not meeting the criteria set forth in subsection (1) above, including ADUs constructed above an existing garage.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)">(3)</span> A minimum setback from the front lot line, as required in the lot's underlying zone district, shall be required for all New Construction ADUs not meeting the criteria set forth in subsection (1) above, including ADUs constructed above an existing garage. No setback is required for a State Exempt ADU.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Unit Access. An ADU must include a separate exterior entrance from the primary residential dwelling unit. An interior access may be provided between the two units, but is not required.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> ADU and JADU Parking Standards.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)">(1)</span> General Requirements. No off-street parking shall be required for any ADU or JADU. The required parking for the primary residential dwelling unit(s) must comply with the underlying zoning district's current standards, except when an existing garage, carport, covered parking structure, or uncovered parking space is converted to an ADU or JADU or demolished in conjunction with construction of an ADU. When this occurs, no replacement off-street parking is required for the primary residential dwelling unit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)">(2)</span> Voluntary Parking. Off street parking for an ADU or JADU may be provided voluntarily. Voluntarily provided parking associated with ADU or JADU development must be located entirely on the same lot, and may be provided in a garage, carport, uncovered, or in tandem orientation. Additionally, the following provisions may be applied to create voluntary parking for an ADU or JADU.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)(A)">(A)</span> When a garage or carport is converted to an ADU or JADU, or demolished in conjunction with construction of an ADU, the existing driveway and curb cut are not required to be removed, and may be maintained as parking area.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)(B)">(B)</span> A maximum of up to two voluntarily provided parking stalls may be provided for each ADU or JADU.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)(C)">(C)</span> The maximum driveway width for single-car garages may be up to 20 feet to accommodate additional off-street parking.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)(D)">(D)</span> Uncovered parking for an ADU or JADU may be located in the required front, side, and rear yard setback areas. If a covered parking structure is proposed to provide voluntary parking below a second-story ADU, the parking structure may be located within the footprint of the proposed ADU, provided that it is outside of the front yard setback of the underlying zoning district. When a parking structure is proposed within a required side or rear setback of the underlying zoning district, the plate height of the parking structure shall not exceed 9 feet in height.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> Architectural Standards. Nonexempt ADUs shall be designed to comply with the following standards, as applicable:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)">(1)</span> Be designed to meet the daylight plane requirements of the R-1 zoning district as applied to the nearest adjacent side and rear lot lines.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(g)(2)">(2)</span> Provide and maintain obscured glazing on second-story windows up to five feet from the finished floor when the windows are located within five feet of a lot line with an abutting residential lot.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(g)(3)">(3)</span> When an exterior staircase is proposed, it shall have a setback of at least five feet from the nearest lot line and the size of the second story landing shall be limited to the minimum area required to allow ingress and egress as specified by the California Building Code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(g)(4)">(4)</span> Rooftop decks or terraces above any portion of an ADU are prohibited.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(g)(5)">(5)</span> When a second-story deck or balcony is proposed within a two-story ADU, the following shall apply:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(g)(5)(A)">(A)</span> Second story decks or balconies shall not be larger than 50 square feet in size; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(g)(5)(B)">(B)</span> No portion of a second story deck or balcony shall be located within the setbacks of the underlying zoning, regardless of the ADU setbacks; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(g)(5)(C)">(C)</span> Decks shall not face adjacent residential properties.</p>
