                <p>WHEREAS, on May 20, 2024, the City Council adopted a resolution to adopt the revised Housing Element of the General Plan for the period of 2023-2031 (Housing Element); and</p>

                <p>WHEREAS, pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&amp;sectionNum=65583.2" title="">Government Code Section 65583.2(c)</a>, Policy H 1.10 of the 2023-2031 Housing Element requires amending the Zoning Code to establish a by-right zoning designation for housing sites reused from prior Housing Elements for housing projects that propose a minimum of 20 percent affordable units for lower income households and allows a minimum of 30 dwelling units per acre; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Housing Element has identified sites that can accommodate sufficient housing units to meet the City's RHNA plus a buffer, and includes 35 nonvacant sites that were identified in the prior housing element and five (5) vacant sites that have been included in two or more consecutive planning periods and were not approved for development; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the zoning designation for by-right residential uses allowing 30 dwelling units per acre is within the density limits of the land use designations of the San Mateo General Plan 2040; and</p>

Environmental Determination.</h2> <p>In accordance with California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines Section 15183, the zoning amendment to establish a by-right residential overlay district and reclassify parcels with the overlay district ("project") is exempt from further environmental review because the Project is consistent with the land use designation for the sites adopted as part of the General Plan 2040 for which an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was certified by the City Council on March 18, 2024 and the allowed residential development density is also consistent with the development density established by zoning or general plan policies. There are no project specific effects that are peculiar to the project or the sites; there are no project specific impacts that the General Plan Update EIR failed to analyze as significant effects; there are no potentially significant off-site and cumulative impacts that the general plan EIR failed to evaluate; and there is no substantial new information which results in more severe impacts than anticipated by the general plan EIR, all as further explained in the CEQA memorandum attached to the staff report. Furthermore, any future development of the sites pursuant to these code amendments would not constitute a "project" for purposes of Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codesTOCSelected.xhtml?tocCode=PRC&amp;tocTitle=+Public+Utilities+Code+-+PRC" title="">Public Resources Code</a> pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&amp;sectionNum=65583.2" title="">Government Code Section 65583.2(i)</a>.</p></div>
