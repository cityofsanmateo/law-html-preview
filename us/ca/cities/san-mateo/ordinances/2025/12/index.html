Such payments shall continue to be an obligation of the property owner and shall be reimbursed by the property owner to the City. The City may consider making such payments in its own discretion or if a tenant household makes a written request to the Department following a property owner's failure to pay the required payments within the period mandated under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/7.50.060" title="7.50.060 Relocation payments by property owners.">section 7.50.060</a>, but in no event later than sixty (60) days following the tenant household's vacation of the dwelling or room. Prior to any City payment to a tenant household, the Director shall make a determination regarding the eligibility of the tenant household for relocation payments. The Department will make reasonable efforts to contact a representative of the property owner prior to making the determination or authorizing the City's payment. However, failure to give prior notice to the property owner shall not relieve the property owner of any obligations under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/7.50" title="Chapter 7.50 PROPERTY OWNER OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO TENANTS DISPLACED FROM UNSAFE OR SUBSTANDARD UNITS">this chapter</a>.</p>

The City Manager, in consultation with the City Attorney, shall have the discretion to reduce the amount of any required reimbursement from a property owner to the City in cases where the factual and legal circumstances warrant such a reduction. The property owner shall reimburse the City within five (5) days of receipt of billing from the City. If the property owner does not make full and timely payment to the City, the City is entitled to recover an additional amount equal to the sum of one-half the amount paid by the City on the property owner's behalf, but not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), as a penalty for failure to make timely payment. The City may also record a lien on the subject property with the County of San Mateo Recorder and shall provide notice of such lien to the property owner and to the County of San Mateo Assessor. The form of such lien and the manner of enforcement and collection shall be as authorized by state or local law. Alternatively, the City may include the unreimbursed amount in any other lien placed on the property by the City to secure payment of enforcement costs. Notwithstanding the above, the intent of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/7.50" title="Chapter 7.50 PROPERTY OWNER OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO TENANTS DISPLACED FROM UNSAFE OR SUBSTANDARD UNITS">this chapter</a> is to place primary responsibility for making relocation payments to displaced tenant households on those property owners who are responsible for code violations, and nothing in this section is intended to relieve or release any such property owner from this responsibility.</p>
