Also, there are no specific proposed changes to maximum residential development densities and is consistent with the development density established by the General Plan.  The Project is also consistent with the implementation policies of the adopted and certified Housing Element and pursuant to certain mandates in state law.  There are no project specific effects that are peculiar to the project or the sites; there are no project specific impacts that the General Plan Update EIR failed to analyze as significant effects; there are no potentially significant off-site and cumulative impacts that the general plan EIR failed to evaluate; and there is no substantial new information which results in more severe impacts than anticipated by the general plan EIR.</p></div>
